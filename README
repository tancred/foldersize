Usage: foldersize [ OPTIONS ] [ base ... ]

  ``base'' is the name of a directory that will be sized
    according to the specified depth.

  OPTIONS are zero or more of the following

  --depth depth, -d depth
    ``depth'' is the folder depth at which the sizing of folders begins.
    For example,

      foldersize -d 2 mydir

    will size all folders in the subfolders of ``mydir'', while

      foldersize mydir

    will size ``mydir'' itself, i.e., the default depth is 0.

  --sort-size, -s
    Specifies that the output should be sorted by size rather than name.

  --reverse, -r
    Reverses the output order.
